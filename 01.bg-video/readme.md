This HTML code defines the structure of a webpage that includes a background video and some content.

1. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is used to tell the web browser that this document is an HTML5 document.

2. The `<html lang="en">` tag is the root of an HTML document and the `lang="en"` attribute declares the language of this web page is English.

3. Inside the [`<head>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Findex.html%22%2C%22%3Chead%3E%22%5D "01.bg-video/index.html") tag, there are several meta tags and a link to an external CSS file:
   - The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
   - The `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag is used for responsive web design. It sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
   - The [`<title>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Findex.html%22%2C%22%3Ctitle%3E%22%5D "01.bg-video/index.html") tag defines the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
   - The `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` tag links an external CSS file to style the HTML document.

4. The [`<body>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Findex.html%22%2C%22%3Cbody%3E%22%5D "01.bg-video/index.html") tag contains the content of the document. In this case, it contains a `<section>` with the class `hero` which includes a video and another section with some content.
   - The `<video>` tag is used to embed a video file in the HTML document. The `src` attribute points to the video file, while the `autoplay`, `loop`, and `muted` attributes mean the video will start playing automatically, will loop indefinitely, and will be muted. The `plays-inline` attribute allows the video to be played in place, within the document layout. The `class` attribute is used to apply CSS styles to the video.
   - The nested `<section>` with the class `content` contains an [`<h1>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Findex.html%22%2C%22%3Ch1%3E%22%5D "01.bg-video/index.html") heading and an [`<a>`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Findex.html%22%2C%22%3Ca%3E%22%5D "01.bg-video/index.html") anchor tag. The anchor tag creates a hyperlink that doesn't lead anywhere (`href="#"`) but could be replaced with a valid URL to make it functional.

   This CSS code defines the styling for the HTML elements in your webpage.

1. The [`*`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22*%22%5D "01.bg-video/style.css") selector targets all elements on the page. It sets the margin and padding to 0, applies `box-sizing: border-box` (which includes padding and border in the element's total width and height), and sets the default font family.

2. The [`.hero`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22.hero%22%5D "01.bg-video/style.css") class styles the section that contains the video and content. It's set to take up the full width of the page (`width: 100%`) and the full height of the viewport (`height: 100vh`). It has a background image that's a linear gradient with some transparency. The `position: relative` allows absolute positioning of child elements relative to this section. The `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center` center its child elements both vertically and horizontally.

3. The [`.content`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22.content%22%5D "01.bg-video/style.css") class centers the text of its elements with `text-align: center`.

4. The `.content h1` selector targets the `h1` element inside the [`.content`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22.content%22%5D "01.bg-video/style.css") section. It sets the font size, color, and weight, and adds a transition effect for when the styles change.

5. The `.content h1:hover` selector targets the `h1` element when it's being hovered over. It changes the text color to transparent and adds a stroke (outline) to the text.

6. The `.content a` selector targets the anchor tags inside the [`.content`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22.content%22%5D "01.bg-video/style.css") section. It styles the links to look like buttons with a border, padding, and a top margin.

7. The `.content a:hover` selector targets the anchor tags when they're being hovered over. It changes the background color to white, the text color to black, and adds a transition effect.

8. The [`.back-video`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22.back-video%22%5D "01.bg-video/style.css") class positions the video absolutely at the bottom right of its parent element (the [`.hero`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22.hero%22%5D "01.bg-video/style.css") section), and sets its `z-index` to `-1` to place it behind other content.

9. The `@media` rules change the width and height of the [`.back-video`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22.back-video%22%5D "01.bg-video/style.css") class based on the aspect ratio of the viewport. This ensures that the video covers the entire [`.hero`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%2201.bg-video%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22.hero%22%5D "01.bg-video/style.css") section without distortion, regardless of the aspect ratio of the viewport.
